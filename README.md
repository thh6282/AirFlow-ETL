# Airflow ETL Pipeline

This project demonstrates an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline using **Apache Airflow**. The pipeline extracts data from a source, transforms it, and loads it into a destination (e.g., a database or data warehouse).


## Running the Pipeline
Place the DAG file in the dags folder of your Airflow installation.

Trigger the DAG manually from the Airflow UI or wait for the scheduled execution.

Monitor the progress of the pipeline in the Airflow UI.

## Monitoring
Use the Airflow UI to monitor the status of your DAGs and tasks.

Check logs for each task to debug issues.

Set up alerts for task failures using Airflow's notification features.
